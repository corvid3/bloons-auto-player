automatically plays deflation on infernal for a set amount of time  
gains about 60k profile xp every 5 minutes

### **! does not work on windows !**
only works on _X11_ compatable machines

make sure you have infernal unlocked, silly  
takes control of keyboard, doesn't run in the background  

thrown together in like. an hour and a half.  

i'll eventually add some more features (e.g. place another tower to get xp)
