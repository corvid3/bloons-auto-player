automatically plays deflation on infernal for a set amount of time

### ! does not work on windows !
only works on X11 compatable machines

make sure you have infernal unlocked, silly
takes control of keyboard, doesn't run in the background

thrown together in like. an hour and a half.

i'll eventually add some more features (e.g. place another tower to get xp)
